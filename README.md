## Description

Unit 17 NoSQL: This project features a workout tracking application to view and track daily workouts. The goal of this project was to create a Mongo database with Mongoose schema utilizing route handling with Express. Front end code was provided from UW Coding Bootcampt (Trilogy). 

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
